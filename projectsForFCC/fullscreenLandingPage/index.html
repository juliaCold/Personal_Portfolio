    <p>Sometimes someone would speak in a boat. 
        But most of the boats were silent except 
        for the dip of the oars. They spread apart 
        after they were out of the mouth of the 
        harbour and each one headed for the part 
        of the ocean where he hoped to find fish. 
        The old man knew he was going far out and 
        he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out 
        into the clean early morning smell of the ocean. 
        He saw the phosphorescence of the Gulf weed 
        in the water as he rowed over the part of the ocean 
        that the fishermen called the great well because 
        there was a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms 
        where all sorts of fish congregated because 
        of the swirl the current made against the steep walls 
        of the floor of the ocean. Here there were concentrations 
        of shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools of squid 
        in the deepest holes and these rose close to the surface 
        at night where all the wandering fish fed on them.</p>

    <p>In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming 
        and as he rowed he heard the trembling sound as flying 
        fish left the water and the hissing that their stiff set 
        wings made as they soared away in the darkness. 
        He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal 
        friends on the ocean. He was sorry for the birds, 
        especially the small delicate dark terns that were always 
        flying and looking and almost never finding, and he thought, 
        "The birds have a harder life than we do except for 
        the robber birds and the heavy strong ones. 
        Why did they make birds so delicate and fine as those 
        sea swallows when the ocean can be so cruel? She is kind 
        and very beautiful. But she can be so cruel and 
        it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, 
        dipping and hunting, with their small sad voices 
        are made too delicately for the sea."</p>
